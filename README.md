# Drifting-Speckle

This research is for Singapore Young Physicists' Tournament 2020

# Problem Statement

The problem statement is:

Shine a laser beam onto a dark surface. A granular pattern can be seen inside the spot. 
When the pattern is observed by a camera or the eye, that is moving slowly, the pattern seems to drift relative to the surface. 
Explain the phenomenon and investigate how the drift depends on relevant parameters.

# Example

Here are examples of experimental vs theorical (simulation) results:
